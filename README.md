    Xcode 13.2.1
    Swift 5.5

## Steps to run the app

    Build and then run current scheme. The project will display the Names of the Employees and then wehn clicked it will portrait all the information desired.

## What areas of the app did you focus on?

    I focused this project in trying to make it as simple as possible for the user to interact with. I alwasys try to focus on the UI of the applications I work on and making sure that the architechture has a great flow to it.


## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?

    The reason for my focus was to make an app that would achieve exactly what was asked for. I tried to fix problems pulling the JSON in different ways and seeing which one worked better.

## How long did you spend on this project?

    I spent 8 hours on this project, after the 8 hours I stopped as per the project guidelines. 

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?

    With more time in this project I could have make the app interface look cleaner. But I believe it looks good as it is now. I definetely learned a lot from this project and also displayed my coding skills on it.

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

    I had some issues pulling the JSON but then I realized that because of the first "{" it was a dictionary so I had to work on that for some time until I fixed that issue.

## Did you copy any code or dependencies? Please make sure to attribute them here!

    None for this project.
    As long as I can, I avoid external dependencies unless they add something to the project that I really need.

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?

    It has been a little since I had to create an app from scratch. I tried my best doing it with the knowledge that I already have and I got stuck in some parts of the project. I know that with more time I would've completed the app in a better timely manner and best as possible. In am very excited to keep learning from Xcode and swift to be able to complete any kind of app. 
    
    If I get the position at Block I would most definetely won't take it for granted and will put my best effort in learning anything needed as well as finishing certifications that I am currnetly pursuing.
